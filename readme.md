# andreehansson.se&mdash;a jekyll website
This is my personal website created with jekyll and a few other tools. It's very hacky at the moment due to me being new to Ruby, jekyll, all the tools and so on.

To get this running you'll need:

* jekyll
* jammit
* optipng
* compass

You're very welcome to fork/fix/send an issue!
